# Single computer makes life easier

## Need more than one

* Computers usually break
* Need more than one

## Various and many models

* Weaker models often provide better peformance, but are more difficult to reason about.

# Linearizability

## Basically

* Pretend we only have one computer 
* Single thread of control
* _So_ much easier to reason about

## Definition

* Defined in [Linearizability: a correctness condition for concurrent objects](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/78969.78972)
* Provides atomicity, consistent wall-clock ordering
* Defined In terms of an application state machine (eg: a queue, stack, &c)
* Can be checked automatically

## ...

* Each call takes a finite amount of time
* Effect can happen atomically within that window
* Allows for _some_ reordering.
* Locality; system is correct iff each individual object is correct
