# Single computer makes life easier

## Need more than one

* Computers usually break
* Need more than one

## Various and many models

* Weaker models often provide better peformance, but are more difficult to reason about.

# Linearizability

## Basically

* Pretend we only have one computer 
* Single thread of control
* _So_ much easier to reason about

## Definition

* Defined in [Linearizability: a correctness condition for concurrent objects](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/78969.78972)
* Provides atomicity, consistent wall-clock ordering
* Defined In terms of an application state machine (eg: a queue, stack, &c)
* Can be checked automatically

## ...

* Each call takes a finite amount of time
* Effect can happen atomically within that window
* Allows for _some_ reordering.
* Locality; system is correct iff each individual object is correct

# Algorithm breakdown

## Haskell

```haskell
checkHistory :: forall req res s. (Eq req, Eq res, Show req, Show res, Show s)
             => ModelFun s req res
             -> s
             -> [(Process, HistoryElement req res)]
             -> Either (NotLinearizable req res) [Linearization req res]
checkHistory model initialState h = runExcept $ go Map.empty Map.empty initialState 0 h
  where
    go calls rets s depth history =
      doneRule <|> observationRule <|> linRule
      where
	-- ...
```
## Are we nearly there yet?
```haskell
-- ...
doneRule = do
  if history == [] && Map.null calls && Map.null rets
  then return []
  else empty

-- ...
```
## Observe an event
```haskell
-- ...
-- From Testing from "Testing for Linearizability", Gavin Lowe
observationRule = case history of
    (p, op) : future -> do
      case (op, Map.lookup p calls, Map.lookup p rets) of
        (Call req, Nothing, Nothing) -> do
          go (Map.insert p req calls) rets s (succ depth) future
        (Ret res, Nothing, Just (_call, expected)) | (res == expected) -> do
          go calls (Map.delete p rets) s (succ depth) future

-- ...
```
## Raise error for events that don't match our model
```haskell
-- observationRule continued
        (Ret res, Nothing, Just (_call, expected)) -> do
          throwE $ NotLinearizable (ModelMismatch _call expected res) []
        _ -> do
          throwE $ NotLinearizable (NonMatchInObservable op) []
    [] -> do
          throwE $ NotLinearizable (ExpectingOp) []

  -- ...
```
## Synthesize linearisation point
```haskell
-- ...
linRule = do
  rs <- asum $ flip fmap (Map.toList calls) $ \(p, req) -> do
    let (s', ret) = model s req
    let lin = Op p req ret
    rest <- go (Map.delete p calls) (Map.insert p (req, ret) rets) s' (succ depth) history
      `catchE` prefixErrorWith lin

    return $ lin : rest

  return rs
  -- ...
```
## helpers
```haskell
-- ...
prefixErrorWith :: Linearization req res
                -> NotLinearizable req res
                -> Except (NotLinearizable req res) a
prefixErrorWith lin err =
  throwE $ err { linPrefix = lin : linPrefix err }
```
